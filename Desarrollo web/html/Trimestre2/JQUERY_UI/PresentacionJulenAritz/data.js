    "The datepicker is tied to a standard form input field. Focus on the input (click, or use the tab key) to open an interactive calendar in a small overlay. Choose a date, click elsewhere on the page (blur the input), or hit the Esc key to close. If a date is chosen, feedback is shown as the input's value.",
    "Use different animations when opening or closing the datepicker. Choose an animation from the dropdown, then click on the input to see its effect. You can use one of the three standard animations or any of the UI Effects.",
    "The datepicker can show dates that come from other than the main month being displayed. These other dates can also be made selectable.",
    "Display a button for selecting Today's date and a Done button for closing the calendar with the boolean showButtonPanel option. Each button is enabled by default when the bar is displayed, but can be turned off with additional options. Button text is customizable.",
    "Display the datepicker embedded in the page instead of in an overlay. Simply call .datepicker() on a div instead of an input.",
    "Show month and year dropdowns in place of the static month/year header to facilitate navigation through large timeframes. Add the boolean changeMonth and changeYear options.",
    "Set the numberOfMonths option to an integer of 2 or more to show multiple months in a single datepicker.",
    "Display date feedback in a variety of ways. Choose a date format from the dropdown, then click on the input and select a date to see it in that format.",
    "Click the icon next to the input field to show the datepicker. Set the datepicker to open on focus (default behavior), on icon click, or both.",
    "Localize the datepicker calendar language and format (English / Western formatting is the default). The datepicker includes built-in support for languages that read right-to-left, such as Arabic and Hebrew.",
    "Populate an alternate field with its own date format whenever a date is selected using the altField and altFormat options. This feature could be used to present a human-friendly date for user selection, while passing a more computer-friendly date through for further processing.",
    "Restrict the range of selectable dates with the minDate and maxDate options. Set the beginning and end dates as actual dates (new Date(2009, 1 - 1, 26)), as a numeric offset from today (-20), or as a string of periods and units ('+1M +10D'). For the last, use 'D' for days, 'W' for weeks, 'M' for months, or 'Y' for years.",
    "Select the date range to search for.",
    "The datepicker can show the week of the year. The default calculation follows the ISO 8601 definition: the week starts on Monday, the first week of the year contains the first Thursday of the year. This means that some days from one year may be placed into weeks 'belonging' to another year."
